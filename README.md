# MVVM-Tutorial


## Motivation

I love MVVM architecture, and I've been using it for all my iOS projects. I asked developers whether they wanted to learn MVVM and this project is a result of that.

## Introduction

MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel. It decouples the UI code from the business logic by introducing another layer/component called View-Model.

View-Model contains all the logic and data manipulation and directly interacts with the Model. It's not coupled with the View (View Controller).

Benefits of using MVVM-
Improved testability.
Ease of Use.
Smaller and Modular View-Controllers.
No duplicated code to updates views.
